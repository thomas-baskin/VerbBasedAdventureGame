We have directional commands, ie go north, dig down, go through window*. Verb followed by preposition.

We have Verb Object command formats, ie open mailbox, enter building, blow out lantern.

We have special commands, ie clear, restart, look, inventory**.


Idea:
Each object holds a list of usable verbs that can influence it. You can swing a lantern but you cannot climb a lantern.
Each object is influenced differently by each of those verbs.
Each object has a base case verb response, ie I do not understand you command.
If the player uses a known verb incorrectly, use "if contains" to give suggestions for how to use the verb.
All objects have a description. Type "mailbox" > This is an old, open mailbox whose contents have been emptied.
One cannot read the description of an object if they are not in the same locale as the player.
All objects hold a location.
When the player changes location, the objects in their pack change location.

Visual:
>Welcome to the game. You see a white house with a mailbox.
-Take mail.
>You packed "a letter".
-read letter
>This letter is addressed to ---. Written in blue ink it says:...
-go south



*may not include verb preposition object combos
**some commands may not need verbs, ie open inventory (open is not necessary).
